Q4. Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.

Solution:
In JavaScript, the comma operator allows you to evaluate multiple expressions within a single statement. It evaluates each expression from left to right and returns the value of the rightmost expression. The comma operator is often used in places where multiple expressions need to be evaluated but only one value is expected.

let x = 1, y = 2, z = 3;

let sum = (x + y, y + z); // Here, (x + y) is evaluated but its value is discarded, and the expression (y + z) is evaluated and its value is assigned to sum.

console.log(sum); // Output will be 5, because the expression (y + z) is the rightmost expression.
